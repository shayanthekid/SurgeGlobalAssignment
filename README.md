## Technologies used

This project leverages a variety of technologies and practices to provide a robust and secure application. Below are some key highlights:

### User Authentication

For user authentication, the project utilizes the `react-auth-kit` library, which seamlessly handles user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This library streamlines the process of managing user sessions and enhances the security of your application.

In addition, the project integrates `react-simple-captcha`, a library that adds CAPTCHA functionality to authentication forms. This enhances the authentication process by preventing automated bot attacks and ensuring that users are genuine.

### Backend Development

The project's backend development follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, ensuring a clean and organized codebase. MongoDB is employed as the database of choice, providing a flexible and scalable solution for data storage.

### Security and Clean Code

Security is a top priority throughout the project. From user authentication to data storage, careful considerations have been made to implement best practices and safeguard user data. The adherence to MVC architecture contributes to maintainable and readable code, promoting the separation of concerns and enhancing code quality.

This project demonstrates a commitment to utilizing cutting-edge technologies and industry best practices to deliver a secure, efficient, and user-friendly application.

Feel free to explore the project's codebase to learn more about how these technologies are integrated to create a robust and secure experience for users.
